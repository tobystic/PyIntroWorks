Step 1 - Install Windows Subsystem for Linux
Windows has a tool called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), that allows you to run a GNU/Linux environment on your Windows machine without the overhead of having to run a dual booting system on your machine.

To install WSL on your machine open up an elevated PowerShell command and type:

wsl --install
This will download the latest Linux kernel, and install a Linux distribution, by default this is Ubuntu.

Once WSL has been installed you will be asked to set up a username and password.  Follow best practices with this.  If you ever forget the password, you can reset it.

Step 2 - Install Ruby
The cfn-nag tool has a dependency on Ruby so we need to ensure that is installed.  We can do this by issuing the command within our WSL terminal:

sudo apt install ruby
Step 3 - Install the cfn-nag tool
Now you have all the dependencies installed you can install the tool itself.  To do that we use the following command:

sudo gem install cfn-nag
